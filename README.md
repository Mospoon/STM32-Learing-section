## Our Philosophy

We follow simple but powerful principles:

### 1️ Don’t Reinvent the Wheel

If a solution already exists, study it, adapt it, and improve it.
Professionals build on existing knowledge, so should we.

### 2️ Always See What Others Do

Look at open-source projects, tutorials, GitHub repos, and other engineers’ work.
You learn faster by standing on the shoulders of others.

### 3 Use Google & Read Application Notes

Most real-world engineering problems are solved by reading:

* Application notes
* Reference manuals
* Forum discussions (ST Community, StackOverflow, etc.)
* Datasheets

### 4 No One Is an Expert, We Are All Professional Googlers

What matters is not what you know by heart,
but your ability to search, understand, and apply information quickly.
